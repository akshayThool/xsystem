# Notes

## Repo Maintenance

Everytime try updating the packages in our project in order to have the latest available versions of all the dependencies. The link to the npm outdate is [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-outdated).
Once all the packages are found out which are not in their latest version form, they can be updated by using the command `npm update`. More info about it can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-update).
